100 is a cool number. 100 epic knights in a smol army. The Gatewatch. They watch the interdimensional gates which connect all realms. Lots of terrible things come through the
gates and also lots of good things. The gates allign in a sort of cycle which the Watch has charted. There are multiple cycles which sort of coencide so it's not one set
circle necessarily. Once every one thousand years theres some extra bad stuff. Their main fort is built around the biggest gate and they have outposts near every other one
in the land. Members travel between often. Members never travel in groups smaller than two. Durring particularly difficult invasions they are known to recruit people to help
defend the gates. They occasionally recruit memebers from across the gates. These members usually stay at the main bastion. Let's say theres seven gates. Two are natural
cave openings barely big enough for a person to fit through, three are medium sized two of which are near small towns the third being in a large city, and the last two are of 
large size one being in the main bastion of the Watch the other is high in some snowy mountains very very far from any civilization. This one is deemed the highest risk as it
is the hardest to maintane and viable for a massive invasion. The Watch has a garrison out there that sucks to be at cuz its always super cold. At any time the Watch may have 
1-7ish apprentices around depending on how many old people are on duty. Occasionally watch members die durring hard times. The worst Watch loss of life was roughly 700 years
ago durring the last Big Bad Invasion. 29 Members died as well as all 5 of the apprenitces on watch. It took several years to bring the watch back up to full strength.
